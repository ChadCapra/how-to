## That is, Web Development on a Chromebook

This repo will accompany many online videos walk-throughs for setting up web
development on your Chromebook.

### Why am I doing this?

- Most (maybe all) *newer* chromebooks have linux (beta) available
- Many people can get their hands on a chromebook (due to typically lower cost)
- Linux is a great web development OS 
- Doing something different than everyone else is fun :)

## Let's Begin

### Here are the steps we are going to take along the way

- [ ] Enable Linux
- [ ] give overview, install via download and apt
- [ ] Install Chromebook viewer
